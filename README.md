# Welcome

We are building [a better concert calendar](https://swhenever.com) for the Twin Cities. It comes from people who love the local music scene. We want more people going to shows, and more artists getting the support they deserve. We want to celebrate this great scene; and we need your help to do it!

This project is for contributing and discussing ideas, and communicating with the community about our roadmap.
